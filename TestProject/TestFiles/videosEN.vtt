00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.500
- [RoboKast] I've been playing video games
- 这是第二行

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.280
for nearly 16 years now,

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.150
so I'm pretty familiar
with gaming as a whole.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.015
There are first-person
shooters, platformers,

00:00:08.015 --> 00:00:10.330
simulation games, management games,

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.650
and countless other genres that
are pretty easy to describe.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.090
For example, a first-person
shooter is a game

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.020
where you're in the eyes
of the main character,

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.780
usually shooting something.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.620
A management game is
where you're in charge

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.350
of managing a scenario or
resource in order to meet

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.600
an end goal.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.260
Most modern games fits
snugly into one genre

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.130
or another with an easy explanation,

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.110
like the ones that I just mentioned,

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.860
but sometimes something truly
unique and revolutionary

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.920
comes out and it tests the boundaries

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.430
of these predetermined genres of gaming.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.290
One of the biggest examples
of this that I've seen

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.554
in my life lifetime is "Outer Wilds."

00:00:43.554 --> 00:00:45.480
After recently picking it up to play

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.550
for the first time since
it's released in 2019,

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.910
I have to say that this
game is a truly once

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.500
in a generation gaming experience.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.990
I've never played a game
quite like "Outer Wilds."

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.300
Fusing exploration,
puzzles, mystery, action,

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.680
and space all into a single game,

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.010
with tons of twists and turns
that keep you intrigued,

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.077
is a hard task but Mobius
did an outstanding job.

00:01:08.077 --> 00:01:09.940
"Outer Wilds" is one of the most unique

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.770
and memorable gaming
experiences that I've ever seen.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.930
And today I'm going to try
my best to tell you why.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.620
This game is pretty hard to explain,

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.214
especially without spoiling it,

00:01:19.214 --> 00:01:21.610
so in this video I'm
going to try to help you

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.760
understand what it's about
and why it's so awesome.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.967
I'm telling you that
after watching this video

00:01:26.967 --> 00:01:30.260
you're probably going to
want to play this game.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.410
So instead of rambling on let's go ahead

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.780
and get into today's video,

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.158
talking about why "Outer
Wilds" is so freakin' awesome.

00:01:37.158 --> 00:01:39.130
(upbeat music)

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.070
A lot of games talk about
giving the player freedom,

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.760
freedom to customize your character,

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.050
freedom to choose if you
want to approach a scenario

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.870
with stealth or with guns blazing,

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.980
or freedom to explore an open world

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.250
and find a bunch of cool
locations at your own pace.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.800
I talked a lot about freedom

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.440
in my "Breath of the Wild" review,

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.670
and I spoke about how
that game did it right.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.277
I mentioned how the game says,

00:02:00.277 --> 00:02:03.639
"Hey, here's your end goal and
do it how you want to do it."

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:06.790
Which to me, it sounds like
the definition of freedom.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.096
But the freedom and "Outer
Wilds" is completely different

00:02:09.096 --> 00:02:11.320
and it's on an entirely different level

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.610
from any game that I've ever played.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.610
And that's the first thing
that makes it so awesome.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.510
In "Outer Wilds" there is no
story that you have to follow,

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.232
no end goal, no beginning goal,

00:02:21.232 --> 00:02:24.250
and no explanation of what you have to do.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.104
In the beginning you are given one task,

00:02:26.104 --> 00:02:28.590
which is to get launch
codes to launch your ship

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.300
and explore outer space.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.270
You get the launch codes,

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.950
which activate a single event

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.017
necessary for a core gameplay element,

00:02:35.017 --> 00:02:38.770
and you're thrown into outer
space with no direction at all.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.314
I am not exaggerating.

00:02:40.314 --> 00:02:42.080
They don't tell you anything,

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.240
and you start your adventure
however you want to start it.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.506
You can go to any of the
planets in the solar system,

00:02:47.506 --> 00:02:50.500
land at any point on any of those planets,

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.777
and start your adventure there.

00:02:51.777 --> 00:02:53.980
If something looks cool you can go there

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.590
with no restrictions whatsoever

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.940
and see what that location has to offer.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.380
Even comparing it to a
game like "No Man's Sky"

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.290
it's more open than that.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.780
In "No Man's Sky" you have to make sure

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.520
that you have the resources, fuel,

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.000
and ship necessary to
reach a specific location.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.040
In "Outer Wilds" there is no limit.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.470
You have infinite fuel in your
ship and no food or hunger.

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.530
Your only limited resource is time.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.980
So you may ask what's
the point of this game,

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.938
and what's so cool about being
able to explore something

00:03:21.938 --> 00:03:24.738
if there's no reason for doing so?

00:03:24.738 --> 00:03:26.410
Well, let me explain this to you

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.660
as spoiler free as possible.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.199
While there's no set
goal from the beginning,

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:32.890
you do discover your own goals.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.220
Wherever it is that you may land

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.220
for the first part of your
journey you will find something.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.670
Throughout each of the planets in the game

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.940
there are little landmarks
such as ancient ruins,

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.750
strange gravity-defying villages,

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.310
or weird scientific instruments in orbit.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.700
These locations are all unique

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.260
and they will definitely
catch your interest

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.830
as you fly around the
outskirts of a planet.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.290
In each of these locations
you'll find ancient texts

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.896
or people to talk to.

00:03:54.896 --> 00:03:56.330
Reading the texts or talking

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.880
to some of the other space explorers

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.650
you can learn a small
tidbit of information.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:02.460
The explorers may mention
that they're stuck

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:03.510
because they lost their ship,

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.960
or you may find an
ancient text talking about

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.300
some failed teleportation experiment.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:09.900
Each of these little bits of information

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.738
will always spark some form
of curiosity within you,

00:04:12.738 --> 00:04:15.540
whether it's why the person's
ship suddenly vanished,

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.520
or what the strange experiment
was trying to accomplish.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.030
One thing leads to another
and you inevitably end up

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.900
trying to piece together the story,

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.370
which leads you down another wormhole,

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.533
which you try to piece together and so on.

00:04:27.717 --> 00:04:29.860
"Outer Wilds doesn't have a linear story,

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.580
but your exploration will
cause you to try to figure out

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.816
what happened in a specific situation.

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:36.640
These little sub stories add up

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.960
and result in a web of
mystery that you end up

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.740
trying to solve in order to figure out

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.810
why all of these strange
things are going on

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.350
within the solar system.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.342
Your curiosity is the driving force

00:04:46.342 --> 00:04:48.425
behind the unraveling of this story,

00:04:48.425 --> 00:04:50.600
which makes it feel much more personal,

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.190
and like you are the one in charge

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.720
of how the game is played.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.320
When you think of a
game with a good story,

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.120
you probably think of something
like "The "Last of Us"."

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.721
The "Last of Us" is one of my
favorite games of all time,

00:05:00.721 --> 00:05:02.030
but when you play it,

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.038
you feel like you're living Joel's story,

00:05:04.038 --> 00:05:05.637
which is the point.

00:05:05.637 --> 00:05:07.960
Naughty Dog wrote the
characters and the plot

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.613
to be played out in a specific way,

00:05:09.613 --> 00:05:11.550
making it feel like you're being thrown

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.310
into someone else's life.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.560
On the other side of the spectrum,

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.718
think of a game like "Fallout: New Vegas."

00:05:16.718 --> 00:05:18.410
This is a story-based game

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.886
where you're presented with
choices that change your path.

00:05:20.886 --> 00:05:22.500
You can side with Caesar's Legion

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.748
or you can side with someone else.

00:05:24.748 --> 00:05:27.481
You do things that shape your own story,

00:05:27.481 --> 00:05:30.596
but ultimately the story is
still somewhat predetermined

00:05:30.596 --> 00:05:32.370
and there are only so many ways

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:33.927
that you could change the plot.

00:05:33.927 --> 00:05:36.472
"Outer Wilds" is different
from both of these scenarios.

00:05:36.472 --> 00:05:38.610
While, yes, there's still a story

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.260
talking about the weird occurrences

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.740
and what happened to cause things

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.240
to be the way that they are,

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.170
it isn't predetermined.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.150
You can hop around from
one planet to another

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.583
to piece together different
aspects of the situation

00:05:49.583 --> 00:05:53.280
and discover it in any order
that you could ever imagine.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.740
It's like playing the "Last of Us"

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.827
but starting three fourths
of the way through the story,

00:05:56.827 --> 00:05:59.499
then going back to figure out
how you got to that point,

00:05:59.499 --> 00:06:02.410
and then jumping forward to
use the knowledge you gained

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.460
to figure out how to change the ending.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:05.550
It's hard to grasp,

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.150
but it's another thing
that makes this game

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.540
such a memorable and outstanding one.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.980
Both of these things that I just mentioned

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.580
helped to create the backbone
and foundation of this game,

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.522
but there are layers upon
layers of depth on top

00:06:16.522 --> 00:06:19.330
of each of these core
mechanics that shape this game

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.820
into the polished masterpiece that it is,

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.660
one of which is the world building.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:26.007
In a game where you have to
explore the world on your own

00:06:26.007 --> 00:06:28.140
with a story that you
have to piece together

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:29.127
on your own time,

00:06:29.127 --> 00:06:32.720
it's extremely important that
the world is worth exploring.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.470
If it was boring, had no character,

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.210
and was empty then there
wouldn't be that curiosity

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.757
that made you want to explore
it in the first place.

00:06:39.757 --> 00:06:41.930
"Outer Wilds" has an open
world that is large enough

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:43.190
to make you feel small,

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.450
but small enough to make it memorable.

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:48.401
Each planet has its own
characteristics, design, and charm,

00:06:48.401 --> 00:06:51.160
and every little detail
adds up to paint a picture

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.700
of a solar system worth exploring.

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.961
Ranging from an ocean planet
with endless water spouts

00:06:55.961 --> 00:06:58.430
and storms, to a brittle
shell of a planet,

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.391
with a menacing black
hole in the middle of it,

00:07:00.391 --> 00:07:03.110
each region has its own
unique characteristics

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.840
that make it feel completely different

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.300
from all of the other ones.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.600
Spread along the surface,

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.436
and within the depths of
each of these planets,

00:07:09.436 --> 00:07:12.710
you can find various little
locations that all give you

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.976
the details needed to
piece together the story

00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:18.320
and solve the problem that
plagues you throughout the game.

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.990
One place can give you
a bit of information

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.314
that helps you in another
place and vice versa.

00:07:22.314 --> 00:07:24.740
You have to travel between
these places in your little,

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.250
clunky spaceship to unfold
the mysteries of the galaxy.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:29.350
The world is intertwined,

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:32.180
and the story and every
location has meaning.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.750
Most of your journey will be lonely,

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:36.523
just you and your brain
solving a giant puzzle,

00:07:36.523 --> 00:07:38.943
but spread throughout
are little stems of life

00:07:38.943 --> 00:07:41.630
with fellow travelers doing their thing.

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:43.420
You have lonely, little Esker chilling

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:45.170
on his abandoned moon base.

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:46.870
There's Riebeck playing his banjo

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.537
and waiting around and hanging out.

00:07:48.537 --> 00:07:50.664
And there's you meeting
all of these travelers

00:07:50.664 --> 00:07:52.494
and entertaining them with your presence

00:07:52.494 --> 00:07:54.530
and your quest for knowledge.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:56.590
They don't move around
or do anything crazy,

00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:59.010
but they're there to give you
little bits of information

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:01.450
about the planets you're
on when you need them.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:02.851
They sit there playing their instruments

00:08:02.851 --> 00:08:06.166
and act as a sort of guide
to tell you where to explore.

00:08:06.166 --> 00:08:09.003
While they may be stationary
the planets are not.

00:08:09.003 --> 00:08:12.360
It's not like you're wandering
around a dry and dead world,

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.826
or a world full of NPCs
that walk around in circles

00:08:14.826 --> 00:08:16.870
to make the game feel alive.

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:18.480
The very ground that you stand on,

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.670
and the very solar system
that you're exploring.

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:24.030
is an ever-changing one
based on the passage of time.

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:25.426
Again, without spoiling anything,

00:08:25.426 --> 00:08:28.520
you're always in a fight
against time in "Outer Wilds"

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.820
and time is one of the things
that you have to work with

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.220
in order to progress.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.560
For example, on Hollow Brittle,

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.742
a planet with a black
hole in the middle of it,

00:08:35.742 --> 00:08:38.920
the world is constantly
collapsing due to the black hole

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.790
that's sucking everything inside.

00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:42.340
You have to use this to your advantage

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.310
in order to explore
parts of Brittle Hollow

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:46.070
that were previously hidden.

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:47.820
You also have to find other parts

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.930
before they get sucked
into the black hole.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:52.900
This mentality goes with
every other planet as well,

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.600
and it's important to manage
your time when exploring.

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:58.910
Unraveling bits of
information to form a story

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:01.660
could be a bit confusing
if done incorrectly.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.500
It's like trying to remember
all of the Sekiro lore

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.140
just by thinking about it,

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.810
but a cool aspect of "Outer
Wilds" is the one thing

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:11.300
that helps to tie all of
this information together,

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.670
your ship's computer.

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:14.900
This little portal of
information stores everything

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.210
you've learned throughout your journey

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:18.620
and shows how it connects
and where you found it.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.244
This allows you to easily
go back and reference it

00:09:20.244 --> 00:09:22.850
when needed in order to
continue your adventure

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:24.050
where you left off.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:26.260
This is simple but it's
a huge thing that helps

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.530
to make the task of exploring
so much less overwhelming.

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:31.690
But everything about
the process of exploring

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:32.926
is extremely exciting.

00:09:32.926 --> 00:09:35.070
It's not a walking simulator,

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:36.680
and there's actually a lot of strategy

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.060
to how you get around.

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:39.537
You have a jet pack with limited fuel

00:09:39.537 --> 00:09:41.960
and a space ship with unlimited fuel.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.420
You can enter and exit your
spaceship without any screens

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:45.940
or animations whatsoever,

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:47.630
and traversing around with your jet pack

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.146
is easier said than done.

00:09:49.146 --> 00:09:51.100
Some planets have extra gravity,

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:52.227
some planets have no gravity,

00:09:52.227 --> 00:09:55.700
and others are breaking off
and falling into a black hole.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:58.760
So you have to use what you
have to navigate these obstacles

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.920
while learning information and
piecing together the story.

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.415
You can use these forms of transportation

00:10:03.415 --> 00:10:06.881
alongside the ever-changing
world to help or hurt you,

00:10:06.881 --> 00:10:08.680
like the countless number of times

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.758
that I accidentally got
sucked towards the black hole

00:10:10.758 --> 00:10:14.000
and used its pull to slingshot
me around Brittle Hollow

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.890
and get to where I needed to go.

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.690
I don't know if this
was supposed to be done

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:19.940
but let me tell you, I definitely did it.

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.486
Also, when exploring,
it's not over complicated.

00:10:22.486 --> 00:10:23.870
As you guys know,

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:26.080
I'm a huge advocate for simple game design

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.003
and "Outer Wilds" does this perfectly.

00:10:28.003 --> 00:10:30.820
Flying the spaceship is
easy with a few directions

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:32.550
of thrusters and a way to slow down

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:35.890
and match the speed of a planet,
oftentimes not effectively.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:37.890
Jet pack travel is about the same.

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:39.830
You have a little camera that you can use

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:41.670
to detect something called Ghost Matter.

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.400
You read things by clicking on them,

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.880
and you can find fellow explorers

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:47.410
by listening to their lovely little tunes.

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:49.130
The simplicity of the mechanics allow you

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:51.790
to be able to focus on the
narrative and the mysteries,

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:53.493
and with the other
things I just mentioned,

00:10:53.493 --> 00:10:57.440
help to make "Outer Wilds"
such an amazing game.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.560
I could go on for an hour

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.610
if I was able to get into the details,

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:02.730
but since this is a spoiler-free review,

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:03.783
I don't want to do that.

00:11:03.783 --> 00:11:06.260
"Outer Wilds" is one of
those games that is better

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:07.590
the less you know about it.

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:10.530
I went into it not reading or
watching anything about it,

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:12.450
and it was one of the coolest experiences

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:14.210
that I've ever had in gaming.

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:16.110
So I hope this review gave you a glimpse

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:17.410
into what the game is about,

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:19.650
and convince you that it's worth trying.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:21.650
Again, I was very intentional and vague

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:22.790
with what I talked about

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:24.537
so that you can experience the excitement

00:11:24.537 --> 00:11:28.120
of unraveling the mysteries
of the universe yourself.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.520
Mobius did an outstanding
job with "Outer Wilds,"

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.680
and it's one of the few
games that I will recommend

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.951
to anyone and everyone,

00:11:33.951 --> 00:11:37.030
regardless of their gaming preferences.

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.460
Now that we've reached
the end of the video

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:39.824
I have a quick announcement.

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:42.360
I've gotten into to the
world of reading lately,

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.330
and let me tell you,
it has changed my life.

00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:47.420
I am actually addicted to reading books.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:48.316
Ha, what a nerd.

00:11:48.316 --> 00:11:50.656
So since it's hard to
secure sponsors these days

00:11:50.656 --> 00:11:54.590
this video is sponsored by
me telling to read a book.

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:56.090
I made a list of books that I've read,

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:58.220
and I will link it in
the description below.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:00.360
There are some suggestions
for non-fiction books,

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.570
some for fiction, a few for marketing,

00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:04.300
and some of the ones
that I remember reading

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.514
when I was a teenager.

00:12:05.514 --> 00:12:07.370
My recommendation in this video

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:09.140
is "The Fish that Ate the Whale,"

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.990
which is a true story about
an immigrant banana farmer

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:15.750
in the early 1900s who
single-handedly decided to start

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:17.234
a revolution in Honduras

00:12:17.234 --> 00:12:20.230
because they were a taxing
his American company.

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:21.180
There's more to it than that

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:22.960
and it's an extremely interesting story,

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.384
so I will link it along with
all of my other recommendations

00:12:25.384 --> 00:12:26.715
in the description below.

00:12:26.715 --> 00:12:28.840
The list will constantly be updated.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.290
So be sure to check back if you
want to find some new reads.

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:35.008
I earn a 10% commission on

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.020
supports local bookstores
that are struggling

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.620
in the times of pandemics and Amazon.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.137
Anyways, guys, that's going
to be it for today's video,

00:12:43.137 --> 00:12:45.170
so I hope you all enjoyed.

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:46.780
What are your thoughts on "Outer Wilds?"

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.080
Do you like it as much as I do

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.800
or do you think it's overrated?

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.750
Let me know in the comments below.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.530

I will see you guys next time and peace.
